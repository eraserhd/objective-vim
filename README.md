objvim
======

Scripts for building a nice console Vim for Mac OS X with support for iOS
development.

To install, simply copy the following line and paste into your terminal:

``` bash
curl https://raw.github.com/eraserhd/objvim/master/install.sh |sh
```

When done, you should have a fully configured vim.  Be sure to put the
following in your .bash_profile to use it instead of the system vim:

``` bash
export PATH=~/objvim/bin:"$PATH"
```
